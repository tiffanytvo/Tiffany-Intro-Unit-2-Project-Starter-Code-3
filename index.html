    <p>In 2021, San Francisco has reported a 500% increase in hate crimes against Asians compared to 2020. This is an
      extremely alarming rate of increase, and it still continues to get worse. Our mission is to spread awareness and
      support the AAPI community. </p>

    <p>Unfortunately, there are many more people and elderly Asians who have been robbed or killed while minding their
      own business. There are more awful accounts of these events happening not only in the Bay Area, but in the US.</p>
